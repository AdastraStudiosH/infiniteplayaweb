            <h3>What is The Infinite Playa?</h3>
            <span>The Infinite Playaâ„¢ (TIP) is a Recognized Universe of the Burning Man Multiverse. It is a multi-player, playable experience that puts you at the center of an infinite, explorable world of art, music, games, talks and performances. </span>
          </div>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3>Will i need to buy a ticket?</h3>
            <span>Our intention is to make TIP available to everyone who wants to experience it. Many parts of the experience will be free to all.</span>
            <span>We are doing our best to insure that any form of ticketing will be a nominal fee to cover our costs and to help support the non-profit Burning Man project.</span>
          </div>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3>What platforms will The Infinite Playa be available on?</h3>
            <span>We want everyone to experience the magic of the Playa, so TIP will be widely available on any browser or phone.</span>
            <span>We are also working on making the experience compatible on any smart TV.</span>
            <span style={{ marginTop: '19px' }}>Though this is not a VR experience, we are working on making certain areas in TIP explorable in VR.</span>

            <h3>How can i participate?</h3>
            <span>While Burning Man creates the container for Black Rock City, it is the citizens of BRC  that build it and the same is true of our container. We have built the framework for our world, a sprawling photo-real desert, festival, environment. We need you to make it come to life!</span>
            <span style={{ marginTop: '19px' }}>Artists, Camps and inspired individuals will all have the opportunity to bring their unique offerings to the Infinite Playa. These can range in scale from art pieces and installations rendered with full 3 dimensional detail, to live streamed performances added in via greenscreen, or talks, yoga classes and interactive Zoom panels.</span>
          </div>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3>How big can my camp be?</h3>
            <span>To create as authentic an experience as possible, we are limiting stage sizes to their relative proportions on the Playa.</span>
            <span style={{ marginTop: '19px' }}>For larger camps we are working to make multiple streams/feeds available so that participants can have multiple experience options within one venue. For example, a main stage, and also a smaller more intimate dome/tent interior experience.</span>

          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3>What about my art car? Can you add it and can we drive it? </h3>

          </div>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3>Will i get paid for my art?</h3>
            <span>We adhere to Burning Man's principle of decommodification, we can't pay you for your art, but we can and will credit you with links back to your website and/or social media.</span>
            <span style={{ marginTop: '19px' }}>We will be requiring a release form for all participants that clearly states that we do not own your IP, but you have granted TIP permission to use it for purposes of this digital experience.</span>
